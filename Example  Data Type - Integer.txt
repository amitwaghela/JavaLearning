Integer data type is used to store numeric/numbers in the variable. In technical term, an integer store 32- bit of information and it stores the value between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,484,647. But a decimal number can not be stored in the ‘int‘ data type.

Here is an example:

package JavaTutorials;

public class IntegerTestExersice {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//Use the int keyword to declare integer variable
        int carSpeed;

		//Initialize the integer variable with value 20
        carSpeed = 20;

		//Print the value of integer variable
		System.out.println("Car is running at the speed of: " +  carSpeed);

		//Change the value of integer variable
		carSpeed = carSpeed + 20;

		//Print the value of integer variable
		System.out.println("Current speed of the car is: " +  carSpeed);

	}

}
