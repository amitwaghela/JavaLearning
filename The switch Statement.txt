Switch statement :

provides an easy way to dispatch execution to different parts of your code based on the value of an expression. It is used to replace the multilevel if-else-if statement. But the switch statement can only be used if the conditions are based on the same constant value. The syntax for the switch statement is :

    switch(expression){  
        case value1:
		//Execute if the variable is matched with the case (value1) 
        break;  
        case value2:
		//Execute if the variable is matched with the case (value2)
        break;   
        default:
		//Execute if the variable is not matched with the any case
		break;  
          }


-------------------------- RULES ---------------------------

There are few rules which apply to switch statement:
1) The “expression” must be of type byte, short, int, or char.
2) A switch statement can have an optional default case, which must appear at the end of the switch. The default case can be used for performing a task when none of the cases is true. No break is needed in the default case.
3) Each case must end with colon (:)
4) Each case value must be a unique literal(constant not a variable). Duplicate case value not allowed.
5) Typically each case has a trailing break and a break acts as an exit point.

	public static void main(String[] args) {
