Like this, we can handle multiple conditions as well with the help of if-else_if-else statements. The syntax is:

    if (boolean-expression) {
        // Execute if boolean-expression one is true
    } else if (boolean-expression2) {
        // Execute if boolean-expression two is true
    } else {
        // Execute if boolean-expression is false


------------------------------ CODE -------------------------------

package javaTutorials;

public class IfThenElseIf_Statement {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		String sDay = "Monday";
		int iDay = 1;

		if(sDay.equals("Sunday")){
			System.out.println("Today is Sunday");
		}else if(sDay.equals("Saturday")){
			System.out.println("Today is not Saturday");
		}else{
			System.out.println("Today is a Weekday");
		}

		if(iDay==7){
			System.out.println("Today is Sunday");
		}else if(iDay==6){
			System.out.println("Today is Saturday");
		}else{
			System.out.println("Today is a Weekday");
		}
	}
}


---------------------------------- RESULT --------------------------------

Today is a Weekday
Today is a Weekday

Note: The else if part is optional but it can appear many times between the if and else parts. The else part is optional but it can appear only once after if and all else if parts. If none of the condition is true then else statement will be executed, only one of the statements executed from the list of else if statements.
