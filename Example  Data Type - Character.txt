Character data type is used to store just one character in the variable. It is very rarely used in Selenium. To initialize such a variable, assign a character within the single-quoted. 

Here is an example:


-----------

Above test will produce this:

Value of char is : P

------------


public class CharTestExercise {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//Use the char keyword to declare character variable
        char a;

        //Initialize the char variable with value 'P'
        a = 'P';

        //Print the value of char variable
      	System.out.println("Value of char is : " +  a);

	}

}
