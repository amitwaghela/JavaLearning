Conditional Operator

The conditional operator is the only operator that takes three arguments in Java. The conditional operator is equivalent to if-else statement. It is also known as the ternary operator. This operator consists of three operands and is used to evaluate Boolean expressions. The goal of the operator is to decide which value should be assigned to the variable. The operator is written as:

variable = (expression) ? value if true : value if false


---------------------------- CODE -----------------------------


package SSLCertification;

public class conditionalOperator {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		
		int Ten = 10;
		int Twenty  = 20;
		int Thirty = 30;
		
		boolean bValue;
		int iValue;
		
		bValue = (Thirty == Twenty + Ten) ? true: false;
	     System.out.println( "The boolean value of the variable 'bValue' is : " +  bValue ); //true
	 
	     iValue = ((Thirty == Twenty + Ten)) ? 50: 100;
	     System.out.println( "The int Value of the variable iValue is : " + iValue ); //50
	 
	     //This is a use of Not Logical Operator
	     iValue = (!(Thirty == Twenty + Ten)) ? 50: 100;
	     System.out.println( "The int Value of the variable iValue is : " + iValue ); //100

	}

}


---------------------------------- RESULT -------------------------------------


The boolean value of the variable 'bValue' is : true
The int Value of the variable iValue is : 50
The int Value of the variable iValue is : 100
