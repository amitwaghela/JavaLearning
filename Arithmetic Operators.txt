Arithmetic operators 



perform the same basic operations you would expect if you used them in mathematics. They take two operands and return the result of the mathematical calculation. There are seven important arithmetic operators available in Java:

Addition ‘+’ : This adds two numbers or concatenate two strings
Subtraction ‘-‘ : This subtracts right-side operand from the left side operand
Multiplication ‘*’ : This multiplies two numbers
Division ‘/’ : This divides left side operand by the right side operand
Modulo ‘%’ : This divides left side operand by the right side operand and returns the remainder
Increment ‘++’ : This increases the value by 1
Decrement ‘- -‘ : This decreases the value by 1

------------ Code -------------


package javaTutorials;

public class Arithmetic_Operators {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a, b = 10, c = 5;
		a = b + c;
		System.out.println("Value of 'a' after '+' Arithmetic operation is " + a);
		a = b - c;
		System.out.println("Value of 'a' after '-' Arithmetic operation is " + a);
		a = b * c;
		System.out.println("Value of 'a' after '*' Arithmetic operation is " + a);
		a = b / c;
		System.out.println("Value of 'a' after '/' Arithmetic operation is " + a);
		a = b % c;
		System.out.println("Value of 'a' after '%' Arithmetic operation is " + a);
		b++;
		System.out.println("Value of 'b' after '++' Arithmetic operation is " + b);
		c--;
		System.out.println("Value of 'c' after '--' Arithmetic operation is " + c);
	}

}

Output

Value of ‘a’ after ‘+’ Arithmetic operation is 15
Value of ‘a’ after ‘-‘ Arithmetic operation is 5
Value of ‘a’ after ‘*’ Arithmetic operation is 50
Value of ‘a’ after ‘/’ Arithmetic operation is 2
Value of ‘a’ after ‘%’ Arithmetic operation is 0
Value of ‘b’ after ‘++’ Arithmetic operation is 11
Value of ‘c’ after ‘–‘ Arithmetic operation is 4
