A variable name can be of single letter of alphabets (A-Z).
Variable name can start only with a letter, under score ‘_’ and the dollar sign ‘$’.
A variable name can not start with digit.
A variable name can include digits.
The name of a variable cannot be one of the words that the Java languages have reserved for its own use such as static, this, void, final, for, etc.
 
------------------------

Everybody follows their own pattern to declare variables and I follow my own. I usually declare all the string variables with small letter ‘s’ and int variable with small letter ‘i’. So that in my program when I see any variable starts with the letter ‘s‘, I can understand that it is a String variable. For example:

String sName = “ToolsQA”;

int iNum = 10;

bollean bResult = true;

Example of declaring multiple variables:

int a, b, c;         // Declares multiple int, a, b, and c.
int a = 10, b = 20, c= 30;  // Example of multiple initialization

int a, b, c;         // Declares multiple int, a, b, and c.
int a = 10, b = 20, c= 30;  // Example of multiple initialization
